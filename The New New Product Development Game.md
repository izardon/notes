> 舊: 階段性專業分工 Type A ( eg. waterfull )
> 新: 專業合作 Type B and C ( eg. agile )

> ### Fuji-Xerox改善"relay race"(PPP system)方法為"sashimi" system:
> 1. 從6個階段該為4個階段，重新定義每個階段的目標。
> 2. 改善linear, sequential system為"sashimi" system (指生魚片 Overlapping 的擺放法)
 The sashimi system requires extensive interaction not only among project members but also with suppliers.

在類似中繼的PPP系統中，*關鍵問題往往發生在一組將項目傳遞到下一組的點上*。 橄欖球方法通過保持各個階段之間的連續性來解決此問題。

# new product development processes:

### 1. Built-in instability
Top management kicks off the development process by signaling a broad goal or a general strategic direction.

### 2. Self-organizing project teams

A group possesses a self-organizing capability when it exhibits three conditions: autonomy, self-transcendence, and cross-fertilization. 

- Autonomy: 自治，高層提供環境與金錢給 project team 開發，不過度干涉
- Self-transcendence: 自我超越
- Cross-fertilization: 由具有不同職能專業，思維過程和行為模式的成員組成的項目團隊進行新產品開發

### 3. Overlapping development phases
自組織由不同職能專業的成員組成，通過重疊開發過程，成員們從"zero information"就開始一起工作、分享知識，可以從單獨的個體，更快的融合成一個整體

- 優點:
The overlapping approach has both merits and demerits. Greater speed and increased flexibility are the “hard” merits. But the approach also has a set of “soft” merits relating to human resource management. The overlap approach enhances shared responsibility and cooperation, stimulates involvement and commitment, sharpens a problem-solving focus, encourages initiative taking, develops diversified skills, and heightens sensitivity toward market conditions.
- 缺點:
The more obvious demerits result from having to manage an intensive process. Problems include communicating with the entire project team, maintaining close contact with suppliers, preparing several contingency plans, and handling surprises. This approach also creates more tension and conflict in the group. As one project member aptly put it, “If someone from development thinks that 1 out of 100 is good, that’s a clear sign for going ahead. But if someone from production thinks that 1 out of 100 is not good, we’ve got to start all over. This gap in perception creates conflict.”

### 4. “Multilearning”
Such learning by doing manifests itself along two dimensions: across multiple levels (individual, group, and corporate) and across multiple functions. We refer to these two dimensions of learning as “multilearning.”

1. Multilevel learning: individual, group, and corporate

2. Multifunctional learning: Experts are encouraged to accumulate experience in areas other than their own. (鼓勵在自己擅長以外的領域積累經驗)

### 5. Subtle control
The emphasis is on “self-control”, “control through peer pressure”, and “control by love”, which collectively we call “subtle control”.

Subtle control is exercised in the new product development process in seven ways:

1. Selecting the right people for the project team while monitoring shifts in group dynamics and adding or dropping members when necessary. 

2. Creating an open work environment.
    
3. Encouraging engineers to go out into the field and listen to what customers and dealers have to say.

4. Establishing an evaluation and reward system based on group performance.

5. Managing the differences in rhythm throughout the development process. As mentioned earlier, the rhythm is most vigorous in the early phases and tapers off toward the end.

6. Tolerating and anticipating mistakes.

7. Encouraging suppliers to become self-organizing. Involving them early during design is a step in the right direction. But the project team should refrain from telling suppliers what to do.
    
### 6. Organizational transfer of learning
成員將學習成果轉移給小組以外的其他人
The transfer took place through “osmosis”—by assigning key individuals to subsequent projects.

- 自然，公司會嘗試將其成功經驗教訓制度化，但條件是需在穩定的外在環境下。
- 因此，有些公司會選擇忘記過去成功的經驗，並根據環境變化學習當下最好的方式。

# Some Limitations:
Some words of caution are in order. The holistic approach to product development may not work in all situations. It has some built-in limitations:

1. It requires extraordinary effort on the part of all project members throughout the span of the development process. Sometimes, team members record monthly overtime of 100 hours during the peak and 60 hours during the rest of the project.

2. It may not apply to breakthrough projects that require a revolutionary innovation. This limitation may be particularly true in biotechnology or chemistry.

3. It may not apply to mammoth projects like those in the aerospace business, where the sheer project scale limits extensive face-to-face discussions.

4. It may not apply to organizations where product development is masterminded by a genius who makes the invention and hands down a well-defined set of specifications for people below to follow.

# Managerial Implications

To achieve speed and flexibility, companies must manage the product development process differently. Three kinds of changes should be considered.

#### 1.First, companies need to adopt a management style that can promote the process. Executives must recognize at the outset that product development seldom proceeds in a linear and static manner. It involves an iterative and dynamic process of trial and error. To manage such a process, companies must maintain a highly adaptive style.

- Top management encourages trial and error by purposely keeping goals broad and by tolerating ambiguity. But at the same time, it sets challenging goals and creates tension within the group and within the organization.

- The process by which variety is amplified (differentiation) and reduced (integration) takes place throughout the overlapping phases of the development cycle. Differentiation, however, tends to dominate the concept development phase of the cycle, and integration begins to take over the subsequent phases.
    
- Operational decisions are made incrementally, but important strategic decisions are delayed as much as possible in order to allow a more flexible response to last-minute feedback from the marketplace.
    
#### 2.Second, a different kind of learning is required.
- 傳統方法下，高品質的團隊進行新產品開發，成員都是由菁英組成，知識在聚焦在狹窄的區域(深度學習)，基於個人的累積。

- 新方法下，非專家負責產品開發，鼓勵他們在工作中獲得必要的知識與技能。專家無法在1％的時間內容忍錯誤，非專家們則願意挑戰現狀。 但是，這樣做，他們必須從管理的各個領域，組織的不同級別，職能專業領域甚至組織邊界積累知識。 這種廣度的學習是共同分工有效發揮作用的必要條件。

#### 3.Third, management should assign a different mission to new product development. Most companies have treated it primarily as a generator of future revenue streams. But in some companies, new product development also acts as a catalyst to bring about change in the organization.
